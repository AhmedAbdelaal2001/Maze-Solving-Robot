# Maze-Solving-Robot
## Overview
The main purpose of this project was to build a robotic car that can enter into a maze, explore it fully to find the shortest path to the exit, and then follow that path in subsequent rounds to solve the maze as quickly as possible. The maze is in the form of black lines that the car must follow, and the line following software uses PID control to ensure stability.
## Needed Components
1. An Arduino Board (Nano, Uno, or Mega)
2. 5 Line Tracking Sensors (TCRT5000 Modules are preferred)
3. 1 L298N Dual H-Bridge Driver Board
4. 2 DC Motors
5. A Suitable Car Body
